To use this code, you must have python installed: https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5/msi/
You must also have pip installed on your system. A guide for this can be found here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-pip-on-windows/
After these two steps, you can use this command to install requirements.txt: pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
From here, you will need to move to the location of the classes.py file in your system and run this command: streamlit run "path/to/classes.py"

This will open the program in a web browser and you will be able to use it from there.
